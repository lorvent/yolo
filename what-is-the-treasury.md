# What is the Treasury?

The Treasury plays a very important role in FINO's FAP protocol. It provides three extremely critical functions for the growth and sustainability of FINO.

The treasury functions as an additional financial support for the RFV. This additional support can become important in the event of an extreme price drop of the $FINO token. It helps to create a floor value for the $FINO token.

The treasury is also used to fund new FINO products, services, and projects that will expand and build up the FAP use cases and FINO economy.

Additionally, the treasury provides funding for marketing FINO.
