# How is the APY Backed?

FINO has integrated a solid RFV structure which takes advantage of the trading volume fees in order to back the staking rewards (rebase rewards) when the BNB/FINO pair supply is worth 2.5% of the total supply.

When the daily RFV gains are greater than or equal to all the Holders Daily ROI, this mean that the Swap Threshold can fill the plus-value generated from the Rebase Rewards.

If the daily RFV gains are lower than the Holders Daily ROI, a portion of the Treasury is added to fill the difference.
