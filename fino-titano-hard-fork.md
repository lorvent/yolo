# Fino = Titano Hard Fork

6\.

**Fully decentralized, Auto-rebase without a need of an external wallet:** Unlike Titano which uses a centralized wallet to call rebase function from outside the contract every 30 minutes, which will bring in a disaster if that wallet is not working as intended, like loosing key, power/internet outage, software/hardware issues, etc. In that case Titano will have no rebase reward at all or even can kill the project if that wallet is hacked and call in with a mega-number reward which inflate the token infinitely. The rebase (auto-reward) of FINO is coded natively in the FINO contract which no need for external rebase call so it cannot be hacked and will not affected by centralized problems.
