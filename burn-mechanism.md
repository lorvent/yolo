# Burn Mechanism?

Auto Burn & Manual Burn Explained

Thanks to our innovative Auto Burn program, each & every transaction 1% of tokens will be burned. This special function controls token inflation over the time.

This is an operation that consists of removing circulating tokens from a cryptocurrency by “burning” them.

The burn is used to support the supply of the project, Titano being the original autostaking they had to think of a burn in relation to the tokens “printed” during the 48 daily rebases. We decided to innovate this principle when we started our Auto Hyper Burn program.

Burning a token means removing it from circulation, which reduces the number of coins in circulation. This mechanism is used to prime a new coin or introduce scarcity, which causes the value of the coin to increase.

Burning of tokens can be done in two ways:

* Manually send it to an unowned BSC address, called an “eater” or “burner” address.
* Or more efficiently, create a contract that is unable to spend it.

In both cases, the burned tokens are unusable.

The burned tokens come from the Burn contract that you can find in the Fino contract. So you can follow the weekly burn.

The burned tokens will be sent to the burn BSC address:

**0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD**

The program starts with 1 billion $FINO reserved exclusively for this purpose and will increase over time. In order not to be a pump and dump program we will perform the burn operations in a linear.

Every week, **\~1-5%** of the total circulating supply will be burned. This percentage will evolve over the days based on our Hyper Burn algorithm.
