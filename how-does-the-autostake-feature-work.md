# How does the AutoStake feature work?

The FAP AutoStake feature is a simple yet cutting-edge function called **Buy-Hold-Earn**, that provides the ultimate ease of use for $FINO holders.

**Buy-Hold-Earn** - By simply buying $FINO and holding the token in your wallet, you earn rebase rewards directly into your wallet. Your tokens will increase every 30 minutes.

Using a Positive Rebase formula, FINO makes it possible for daily token distribution directly proportional to the daily rebase rewards, worth 2.12% of the total amount of tokens a $FINO token held in your wallet. The rebase rewards are distributed on each epoch (rebase period) to all $FINO holders. **This means that without moving their tokens from their wallet, FINO holders receive an annual compound interest of 211,465.20%.**
