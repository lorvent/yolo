# What is an RFV?

**RFV** is the acronym for Risk-Free Value which is a separate wallet in FINO's **FAP** system. The RFV uses an algorithm that backs the Rebase Rewards and is supported by a portion of the buy and sell trading fees that accrue in the RFV wallet.

In simple terms, the staking rewards (rebase rewards) which are distributed every 30 minutes at a rate of **0.0441666%** are backed by the RFV parameter, thus ensuring a high and stable interest rate to $FINO holders.

The RFV is dedicated to buy backs and burns of $FINO tokens when the BNB/FINO pair supply is equal to or greater than 2.5% of the total supply.
